Combifeed
================================================

I wasn't happy with my web site. I didn't like
the code I wrote for it. Updating my web site
was just too time consuming.

I wanted a web site, which would be extremely
easy to keep up to date. Naturally, I thought
about writing a new one from scratch. I takes
time and I want to have a update on my web site
today, not in few weeks.

So I started to look through CMS's. There are
lots of systems that manage content! And every
CMS has their pro's and con's, but it takes
time to find a system which suits me the best.

I started wondering why I'm going though all
this trouble,when I'm not planning to have
lots of test on my web site. I don't planning
to start a blog or write articles. So where
I'm gonna get something to fill my website?

Of course from GitHub! And Twitter! And Flickr! And
every other web application which provides a public
RSS feed!

Combifeed will fetch your RSS feeds and combines
them into one feed. You can visualize the feed
in any way you like.
